# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)



## Permission Issues

If you encounter an error message like the following when accessing resources:

```txt
User admin does not have permission to get configmaps in namespace kube-sentinel in cluster in-cluster
```

This means that user `admin` does not have permission to access `configmaps` resources in the `kube-sentinel` namespace.

You need to refer to the [RBAC Configuration Guide](./config/rbac-config) to configure user permissions.

## Managed Kubernetes Cluster Connection Issues

If you're using a managed Kubernetes cluster (AKS, EKS, GKE, etc.) and encounter authentication errors when adding the cluster to Kube Sentinel, this is usually because the default kubeconfig uses `exec` plugins that require CLI tools (like `kubelogin`, `aws`, `gcloud`, or `glab`).

While Kube Sentinel runs as a server-side application, it now supports native authentication for **AWS EKS** and **GitLab Agent** by configuring your credentials in the **Settings** page.

For other providers (like AKS or GKE), or as an alternative, you should use Service Account token-based authentication.

Please refer to the [Managed Kubernetes Cluster Configuration Guide](./config/managed-k8s-auth) for detailed instructions on both methods.

## SQLite with hostPath Storage

If you're using SQLite as the database and encountering an "out of memory" error when using `hostPath` for persistent storage:

```txt
panic: failed to connect database: unable to open database file: out of memory (14)
```

This issue is related to the pure Go SQLite driver used by Kube Sentinel (to avoid CGO dependencies). The driver has limitations when accessing database files on certain storage backends.

**Solution**: Add SQLite connection options to improve compatibility with hostPath storage. In your Helm values, set:

```yaml
db:
  sqlite:
    options: "_journal_mode=WAL&_busy_timeout=5000"
```

These options enable Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode and increase the busy timeout, which resolves most hostPath compatibility issues.

**Recommended for Production**: For production deployments requiring persistent storage, use MySQL or PostgreSQL instead of SQLite. These databases are better suited for containerized environments and persistent storage scenarios.

For more details, see [Issue #204](https://github.com/pixelvide/kube-sentinel/issues/204).

## AI Features

### Which AI providers are supported?
Kube Sentinel currently supports Google Gemini and OpenAI. More providers can be added through the AI administration interface if they follow a compatible API structure.

### How do I configure my own API key?
If your administrator allows it, you can provide your own API key in **Settings > AI Configuration**. This allows you to use your personal quota and specific models.

### Is my cluster data sent to AI providers?
Data is only sent to the configured AI provider when you explicitly interact with the AI assistant (e.g., asking a question about a resource). Only the necessary context (like resource YAML or logs) is sent to provide accurate answers.

### How can I disable AI chat?
Administrators can disable AI chat for individual users in the **User Management** settings.

## How to Change Font

By default, Kube Sentinel provides three fonts: system default, `Maple Mono`, and `JetBrains Mono`.

If you want to use a different font, you need to build the project yourself.

Build kube-sentinel with make and change the font in `./ui/src/index.css`:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Maple Mono";
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/fontsource/fonts/maple-mono@latest/latin-400-normal.woff2)
      format("woff2"), url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/fontsource/fonts/maple-mono@latest/latin-400-normal.woff)
      format("woff");
}

body {
  font-family: "Maple Mono", var(--font-sans);
}
```
