# Monitoring

Kube Sentinel provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for your Kubernetes clusters through integration with Prometheus and built-in visualization tools.

## Cluster Overview

The **Overview** page acts as a central dashboard for your cluster's health and status. It provides high-level metrics and statistics, allowing you to quickly assess the state of your infrastructure.

### Key Features:
- **Cluster Statistics**: View total counts of Nodes, Pods, Deployments, and other key resources.
- **Resource Utilization**: Real-time charts showing aggregated CPU and Memory usage across the cluster (requires Prometheus).
- **Network Traffic**: Visualize inbound and outbound network traffic trends (requires Prometheus).
- **Recent Events**: A feed of the latest Kubernetes events, helping you spot errors or warnings immediately.

## Resource Monitoring

In addition to cluster-wide metrics, you can monitor individual resources (like Deployments, StatefulSets, and Pods) directly from their detail pages.

### Monitor Tab
When viewing a supported resource, navigate to the **Monitor** tab to see:
- **CPU Usage**: Real-time CPU consumption of the pods associated with the resource.
- **Memory Usage**: Real-time memory usage of the pods.

This granular view helps in diagnosing performance bottlenecks and resource contention issues for specific workloads.

## Prometheus Integration

To enable these rich monitoring features, Kube Sentinel must be connected to a Prometheus instance.

To learn how to configure Prometheus monitoring, please refer to the [Prometheus Setup Guide](../config/prometheus-setup).
