# Security Scanning

Kube Sentinel integrates with the [Trivy Operator](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-operator/) to provide comprehensive security scanning for your Kubernetes workloads. This includes vulnerability scanning, configuration auditing, and secret detection.

## Prerequisites

To use security scanning features, you need to install the **Trivy Operator** in your cluster:

```bash
# Add the Aqua Security Helm repository
helm repo add aqua https://aquasecurity.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

# Install Trivy Operator
helm install trivy-operator aqua/trivy-operator \
  --namespace trivy-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set trivy.ignoreUnfixed=true
```

For more installation options, see the [Trivy Operator documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-operator/latest/getting-started/installation/).

## Security Dashboard

Once Trivy Operator is installed, navigate to **Security** in the sidebar to access the cluster-wide security dashboard. The dashboard provides:

- **Summary Cards** - Quick overview of critical vulnerabilities, config issues, and exposed secrets
- **Vulnerability Distribution** - Breakdown by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Top Vulnerable Workloads** - Workloads with the most security issues
- **Top Misconfigured Workloads** - Workloads with configuration problems

## Report Types

Kube Sentinel displays information from multiple Trivy report types:

### Vulnerability Reports
Scans container images for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Each vulnerability includes:
- CVE ID with link to details
- Affected package and version
- Fixed version (if available)
- Severity rating

### Configuration Audit Reports
Checks Kubernetes resource configurations against security best practices:
- Running containers as root
- Missing resource limits
- Privileged containers
- Missing security contexts

### Exposed Secret Reports
Detects secrets accidentally committed to container images:
- API keys
- Passwords
- Private keys
- Tokens

### Cluster Compliance Reports
Evaluates your cluster against security benchmarks:
- CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
- NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide
- Pod Security Standards (PSS)

The Compliance tab on the dashboard shows pass/fail rates for each benchmark.

## Resource-Level Security

Each workload (Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Pod, etc.) has a **Security** tab that shows:

1. **Vulnerabilities** - CVEs found in container images
2. **Config Audit** - Kubernetes configuration issues
3. **Secrets** - Exposed secrets in images

## Trivy Operator Configuration

For optimal results, enable all scanner types in Trivy Operator:

```yaml
# values.yaml for Trivy Operator Helm chart
trivy:
  # Enable vulnerability scanning (default)
  vulnScanner: true
  # Enable config audit scanning
  configAuditScannerEnabled: true
  # Enable secret scanning
  exposedSecretsScannerEnabled: true
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Security Data Showing

If the security dashboard shows no data:

1. **Check Trivy Operator is installed:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n trivy-system
   ```

2. **Verify CRDs exist:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get crd | grep aquasecurity
   ```

3. **Check for VulnerabilityReports:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -A
   ```

### Reports Not Appearing for New Workloads

Trivy Operator scans workloads on creation. If reports are missing:

1. Check Trivy Operator logs for errors
2. Ensure the namespace is not excluded from scanning
3. Wait for the scan to complete (can take a few minutes)
