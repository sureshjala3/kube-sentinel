# Resource Management

Kube Sentinel offers comprehensive tools for managing your Kubernetes resources directly from the dashboard. You can view detailed information, perform operations, and monitor the status of your workloads.

## Resource Operations

For resources like Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets, you can perform common operations directly from the resource detail view.

### Scaling

To scale a resource (e.g., a Deployment):
1. Navigate to the resource detail page.
2. Click the **Scale** button in the top right corner.
3. Adjust the number of replicas using the input field or the `+`/`-` buttons.
4. Click **Scale** to apply the changes.

### Restarting

You can trigger a rolling restart of your workloads:
1. Click the **Restart** button in the top right corner.
2. Confirm the action in the dialog.

This will update the resource's pod template with an annotation (e.g., `kube-sentinel.kubernetes.io/restartedAt`) to trigger a rollout.

### Deleting

To delete a resource:
1. Click the **Delete** button (red trash icon) in the top right corner.
2. Confirm the deletion in the warning dialog.

This action is irreversible. Please proceed with caution.

## Live YAML Editing

Kube Sentinel includes a built-in YAML editor with syntax highlighting and validation.

1. Navigate to the **YAML** tab in the resource detail view.
2. Edit the configuration directly in the editor.
3. Click **Save** to apply the changes to the cluster.

The editor will validate your YAML before saving, helping to prevent configuration errors.

## Detailed Views

The resource detail page provides several tabs to help you analyze and troubleshoot your resources:

### Overview
Displays the status, replicas, selector, labels, annotations, containers, and conditions of the resource. You can also view init containers and ephemeral containers here.

### Pods
Lists the pods managed by the resource (e.g., pods belonging to a Deployment). You can view their status, IP, node, and age.

### Logs
Stream real-time logs from the pods associated with the resource. You can:
- Select specific pods and containers.
- Filter logs by text.
- Enable auto-scrolling.

### Terminal
Open a web-based terminal directly into the containers of the associated pods. This is useful for debugging and running quick commands inside the container environment.

### Monitor
View real-time resource usage metrics (CPU and Memory) for the pods associated with the resource. This requires Prometheus to be configured.

### History
For resources that support it (like Deployments), the **History** tab shows the revision history, allowing you to track changes over time.

### Events
Lists Kubernetes events related to the resource, helping you identify issues like scheduling failures, image pull errors, or health check failures.

### Related Resources
Visualize and navigate to resources related to the current one. For example, from a Service, you can see the Pods it selects.
